# Daybreak

Programming language that compiles to C

## Motivation

While my wife was pregnant with our first child, I made this for my daughter to be

I wanted to have something to do that would focus me giving my time and energy to my child before I could actually hold and care for them

My baby arrived in 2022 and she is more beautiful and complex than anything I could have made, other than she herself

## Evolution

I got sick of the C codebase and of fixing it to make Daybreak capable of rewriting itself

So then we started a clojure rewrite
